# Solidity programming

- written in .sol files
- strongly typed
- syntax similar to JavaScript
- smart contracts can be easily written in solidity

### Workflow

- **Contract Definition:** write contract in solidity file (.sol)
- **Compile Solidity:** compile .sol files which outputs
  - byte code ready for deployment
  - application binary interface (ABI)
- The front-end or JavaScript will interact with the ABI which serves as a translator to read the jibberish Bytecode.
