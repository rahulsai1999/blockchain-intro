# Smart Contracts

- an account controlled by code instead of people
- similar to a metamask account but controlled by code

## Contents of a Contract account:

- **balance** : amount of ether this account owns
- **storage** : data storage for this contract (any type of data that the application is using)
- **code** : raw machine code for this contract

## Differentiating the account types

- **External account** like Metamask are completely different from these contract accounts as they are owned and controlled by individuals and can be used on any Ether Network.

- **Contract accounts** exist on the specific Ethereum network not controlled by anyone.

## Making contracts

- **Contract source** - code on our machine that instructs the contract how it should behave and how it should handle money, and deployed to a specific ether network.
- **Contract instance** - The actual contract instance or account on the ether network.
